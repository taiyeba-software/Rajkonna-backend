# TODO: Update Product Routes for Delete Functionality

- [x] Update import in src/routes/product.routes.js to include deleteProduct from '../controllers/product.controller'
- [x] Add router.delete('/:id', authenticateToken, deleteProduct); after existing routes
- [x] Verify the file has all routes intact and export is unchanged
